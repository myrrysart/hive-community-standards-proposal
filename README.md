# Hive Helsinki Community Standards 0.1.0 (Proposal)

## Purpose
This collection of standardized protocols and guidelines exists to maintain cleanliness and hygiene at Hive Helsinki. These manuals are designed to be clear, actionable, and easy to reference, similar to traditional Unix manual pages.

## Background
While Hive Helsinki has comprehensive rules and guidelines in place, these manuals serve as practical, day-to-day reference guides for the community. They are created BY the community, FOR the community, to help maintain our shared spaces and ensure a pleasant working environment for all.

## Structure
Each manual follows a consistent format:
- DESCRIPTION: Overview of the protocol
- PROCEDURES: Step-by-step guidelines and considerations
- COMMON ERRORS: Frequently observed mistakes to avoid
- SEE ALSO: Related manuals and references

## Philosophy
At Hive Helsinki, we operate on peer-to-peer principles. These standards are maintained through community responsibility. When you see something that needs attention:
1. Fix it if you can
2. Report it if you can't
3. Help others understand why it matters

## Discussion
This is a living document. These guidelines are hopefully a starting point for our community standards. The discussion manual provides a framework for constructive feedback and continuous improvement of these standards.

A clean, safe, and well-maintained environment helps everyone focus on learning and coding.
